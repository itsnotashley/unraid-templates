# Unraid Community Templates

This repo contains Unraid CA templates for useful Docker apps I’ve come across that weren’t available on the Unraid Community Apps store (yet!). These are **not my projects** — just helpful tools I wanted to make easier to install via Unraid.

## Included Templates

### Immich Automated Selfie Timelapse
- **Project**: [immich-automated-selfie-timelapse](https://github.com/ArnaudCrl/immich-automated-selfie-timelapse)
- **Author**: [ArnaudCrl](https://github.com/ArnaudCrl)
- **Description**: Creates a timelapse video from your daily selfies stored in Immich. Connects to your instance and builds a video via an automated script. Includes a basic web UI on port 5000.

## How to Use This Repo in Unraid

1. Go to the **Community Applications** plugin in Unraid.
2. Click **Settings** > **Add Container Template Repository**.
3. Paste this repo’s URL:

```
https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/unraid-templates
```

4. Save and browse the app via the Community Apps interface.
